# Fullstack Challenge

Build a MongoDB, React, Express, NodeJS full stack application that allows a user to signup, login with a two factor authentication application like Authy, Google Authenticator, etc;. We want a user to be able to sign up giving a username, email, password and a password verification input field and any data that may be needed to setup Multifactor Authentication. We want any necessary data to be stored in our MongoDB database. When a user logins we want the user to be required to login with their email or username and password and with their authentication application.

## Criteria

* Use JWT tokens 
* Use MongoDB for the DB
* Express NodeJS Backend
* React Frontend
* Usage of an authentication app like google authenticator or authy to login
* Security is of utmost importance

## Tips

Please don't spend more than three hours on this! 

We are looking for good logging! We want to be able to tell when things fail, when things succeed, we want to be able to know looking at the logs if the user authenticated properly. If the user logged in successfully etc;

We would love to see good API documentation in the README.md about what the endpoints are, what the responses are, if there is anything needed in the request body etc;

Be secure! Build this with the good security hygenie in mind.

Build it as flexible as possible.
